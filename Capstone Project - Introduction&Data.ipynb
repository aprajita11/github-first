    "Data might contribute in determining a suitable place for this. Gathering all these information and having a clear and vivid idea about all the challenges in opening a new restaurant is a tedious task but it will help all those who are interested in any kind of such ventures before they decide on going on with their investment. It is always a better idea to have investment of such big budget to be at least risk. Having a restaurant in a neighborhood of high population beats a large fraction of risk. Therefore, we will try to analyze the neighborhoods of Brooklyn which are high in population and try to find out the optimised result. We will be using Foursquare location data to explore the Brooklyn and its neighbors and find an ideal location."

    "1. New York has a total of 5 boroughs and Brooklyn is one of them. In order to segment the neighborhood and explore them, a dataset is needed that contains these boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough. There is a free dataset available on web which I found on https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572. This dataset contains all the Boroughs, their Neighborhoods and their Latitudes and Longitudes.\n",
