    "Data might contribute in determining a suitable place for this. Gathering all these information and having a clear and vivid idea about all the challenges in opening a new restaurant is a tedious task but it will help all those who are interested in any kind of such ventures before they decide on going on with their investment. It is always a better idea to have investment of such big budget to be at least risk. Having a restaurant in a neighborhood of high population beats a large fraction of risk. Therefore, we will try to analyze the neighborhoods of Brooklyn which are high in population and try to find out the optimised result. We will be using Foursquare location data to explore the Brooklyn and its neighbors and find an ideal location."
